## Antelope

My current major software project is Antelope, which is a comprehensive data preprocessing, storage, and analysis tool for systems neuroscience labs. Currently, this project is closed source, however, you can take a look at the documentation [here](https://antelope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
