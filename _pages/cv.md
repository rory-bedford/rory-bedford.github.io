## Overview
I'm a neuro data scientist with a strong background in machine learning and physics. As a computational scientist I'm interested in working at the intersection of experiment and theory, and in interdisciplinary teams, with a passion for systems neuroscience, computational neuroscience, and machine learning.

## Experience

### MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Cambridge, UK)
- **Career Development Fellowship (Data Scientist)** (May 2023 -- Present)

    My current major project is Antelope, which is a data management and processing platform for systems neuroscientists. This project provides a graphical user interface to a custom DataJoint pipeline. It supports a number of experimental paradigms, including extracellular electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and behavioural data. Antelope's database schema is designed to be as simple as possible: it tracks all raw data, metadata, and parameters to facilitate reproducible preprocessing, and provides processed data as easily queryable arrays to facilitate analysis. All preprocessing is optimised for the HPC as Nextflow pipelines. We also provide a python package with a comprehensive and extensible analysis suite that acts directly on the database.

    In addition to this I also perform some database/server administration for the lab, and some coding assistance to lab members.

### April19 Discovery Inc (London, UK)
- **Internship/MSc Project Collaboration** (May 2022 -- Oct. 2022)

    My MSc project looked at machine learning approaches to virtual screening. In particular, I used graph neural networks to predict protein-ligand interactions. Additionally with April19 I worked as part of a team using generative AI models applied to fragment-based lead discovery, searching for a drug that can inhibit the enzyme MurD ligase. In particular, I compared the performance of classical docking methods with state of the art deep learning based docking methods in identifying the allosteric site on MurD.

## Miscellaneous

- **Supervision** I co-supervised a master's student working on an image processing summer project. This project involved constructing a brain registration and cell detection pipeline for use on our lab's section image datasets.
