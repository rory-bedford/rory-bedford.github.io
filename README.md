Welcome to my personal webpage. I'm currently working as a neuro-datascientist at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. I am interested in computational neuroscience quite broadly, and have a background in physics and machine learning. You can find links to a few projects I'm working on in the sidebar, as well as my personal blog.
