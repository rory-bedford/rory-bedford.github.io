## Experience

### MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Cambridge, UK)
- **Career Development Fellowship (Data Scientist)** (May 2023 -- Present)

    My current major project is Antelope, which is a data management and processing platform for systems neuroscientists. It supports a number of experimental paradigms, including extracellular electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and behavioural data. It includes custom data preprocessing pipelines on a HPC, results storage in a MySQL database, and a web interface to easily manage this data, as well as a set of standard analysis functions to make the whole process from experiments to meaningful results as smooth as possible for experimenters.

### April19 Discovery Inc (London, UK)
- **Internship/MSc Project Collaboration** (May 2022 -- Oct. 2022)

    My MSc project looked at machine learning approaches to virtual screening. In particular, I used graph neural networks to predict protein-ligand interactions. Additionally with April19 I worked as part of a team using generative AI models applied to fragment-based lead discovery, searching for a drug that can inhibit the enzyme MurD ligase. In particular, I compared the performance of classical docking methods with state of the art deep learning based docking methods in identifying the allosteric site on MurD.

## Teaching

### Leading Education (Oxford, UK)
- **Tutor** (Jan 2021 -- June 2021)

    I taught A-level further maths and physics full time for half a year. This greatly improved my ability to communicate tricky mathematical ideas in a clear and concise fashion, a skill that will be very beneficial in my career. I hope to continue doing some teaching as a part of my work.

## Technical Skills

- **Programming Languages:** Python, Bash, SQL
- **ML/Data Science Tools:** NumPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Jax, Scikit-learn
