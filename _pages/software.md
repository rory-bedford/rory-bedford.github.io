## Receptual

**Receptual** is a lightweight, interactive tool for computing and visualizing neuron receptive fields and linear decoders.

Linear encoding and decoding methods are essential tools for:

* Systems neuroscience  
* Computational neuroscience  
* Deep learning interpretability  

These methods often produce high-dimensional arrays that are difficult to analyze and interpret. Implementation can also be nontrivial.

**Receptual** helps by providing:

* Standardized implementations of linear encoding and decoding algorithms  
* Interactive visualization tools for high-dimensional outputs  
* Detailed mathematical documentation of linear methods

**Antelop** is a comprehensive data preprocessing, storage, and analysis tool for systems neuroscience labs. Developed in the Tripodi Lab, it offers:

* Out-of-the-box preprocessing pipelines for electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and behavior  
* A graphical user interface for managing experimental data  
* SQL backend for structured data storage  
* Visualization dashboards for quick inspection  
* A standard library of analysis routines  
* A reproducibility-focused framework for running and documenting analysis  

Although currently closed source, you can view a project presentation [here](/assets/antelop-medium.html).
