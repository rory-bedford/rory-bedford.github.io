## EquiBind Score

In my master's I worked on geometric deep learning approaches to drug discovery. In particular, I worked on graph neural networks using representation learning to model protein-ligand interactions. This led to the development of a GNN-based binding affinity prediction model called EquiBind Score, in collaboration with April19 Discovery Inc.
