Welcome to my personal webpage. I work in computational neuroscience, with interests in spatial cognitive maps, spiking neural networks, and open source tools for neuroscience. Previously I studied physics and machine learning, then worked at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. You can find links to a few projects I'm working on in the sidebar, as well as my personal blog.
