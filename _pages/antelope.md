My current major software project is Antelop, which is a comprehensive data preprocessing, storage, and analysis tool for systems neuroscience labs. Currently, this project is closed source, however, you can preview the documentation [here](https://antelope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), or see a presentation of the project [here](/assets/antelop-short.html).
