## Overview  
I'm a researcher in computational neuroscience, with a background in machine learning and physics. I'm interested in spiking neural networks and plasticity rules, with a focus on spatial cognitive maps. I'm interested in interdisciplinary approaches that ground theory and simulations in activity recordings and connectomics datasets.

## Experience  

### MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology  
**Cambridge, UK**  
*Career Development Fellowship (Data Scientist/Software Developer) - Supervised by Marco Tripodi*  
**May 2023 -- May 2025**  

My work in the lab focussed on our data engineering and processing requirements, spanning the full life cycle from acquisition to publication. Work I have done includes:  
- Writing custom DataJoint-based processing pipelines on our HPC including DeepLabCut tracking, spikesorting, and ROI extraction and calcium signal deconvolutions.
- Implementing automatic dimensionality reduction algorithms on this data.
- Creating interactive visualisation dashboards of our data.
- Collaborations on publication-ready analysis, statistics and figures with lab members.

### April19 Discovery Inc  
**London, UK**  
*Internship/MSc Project Collaboration - Supervised by Brooks Paige and Andrea Karlova*  
**May 2022 -- Oct 2022**  

My MSc project looked at machine learning approaches to virtual screening. In particular, I designed a novel graph neural network that can predict protein-ligand binding affinities from undocked ligands, using graph-based representations from the modern docking model EquiBind. With April19 I worked as part of a team using generative AI models applied to fragment-based lead discovery, searching for a drug that can inhibit the enzyme MurD ligase.

## Teaching  
- **Teaching assistant:** *King's College Cambridge (Sept 2024 -- May 2025)* I led undergraduate supervisions (small group classes) for 8 students for the Cambridge Natural Sciences Part IA Mathematical Biology course.
- **Master's Supervision:** *Cyril van Leer (June 2023 - Sept 2023)* I co-supervised a master's student working on a project constructing a brain registration and cell detection pipeline for use on our lab's section image datasets.

## Misc.
- **Reading Group:** I founded and led the LMB's computational neuroscience reading group, which covered Dayan and Abbott. See my notes at [Dayan and Abbott Notes](https://rory-bedford.github.io/assets/Dayan_and_Abbott_notes.pdf).
- **Simons Computational Neuroscience Imbizo:** *(Jan 2025 -- Feb 2025)* I attended the Imbizo summer school in Cape Town, where I worked on a project doing network-based modelling of learning in the Drosophila mushroom body.
