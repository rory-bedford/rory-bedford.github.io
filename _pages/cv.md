## Overview  
I'm currently working as a data scientist in a systems neuroscience lab, and have a strong background in machine learning and physics. As an aspiring computational neuroscientist I'm interested in spiking neural networks and plasticity rules, and how these lead to complex computations and representations in the brain. I'm interested in interdisciplinary approaches that ground theory in known biological mechanisms and recordings.

## Experience  

### MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology  
**Cambridge, UK**  
*Career Development Fellowship (Data Scientist) - Supervised by Marco Tripodi*  
**May 2023 -- Present**  

My work in the lab focuses on our data engineering and processing requirements, spanning the full life cycle from acquisition to publication. Work I have done includes:  
- Writing custom DataJoint-based processing pipelines on our HPC including DeepLabCut tracking, spikesorting, and ROI extraction and calcium signal deconvolutions.
- Implementing automatic dimensionality reduction algorithms on this data.
- Creating interactive visualisation dashboards of our data.
- Collaborations on publication-ready analysis, statistics and figures with lab members.

### April19 Discovery Inc  
**London, UK**  
*Internship/MSc Project Collaboration - Supervised by Brooks Paige and Andrea Karlova*  
**May 2022 -- Oct. 2022**  

My MSc project looked at machine learning approaches to virtual screening. In particular, I designed a novel graph neural network that can predict protein-ligand binding affinities from undocked ligands, using graph-based representations from the modern docking model EquiBind. With April19 I worked as part of a team using generative AI models applied to fragment-based lead discovery, searching for a drug that can inhibit the enzyme MurD ligase.

## Teaching  
- **Teaching assistant** 
- **Supervision:** I co-supervised a master's student working on a project which involved constructing a brain registration and cell detection pipeline for use on our lab's section image datasets.
- **Reading Group:** I founded and led the LMB's computational neuroscience reading group, which covered Dayan and Abbott. See my notes at [Dayan and Abbott Notes](https://rory-bedford.github.io/assets/Dayan_and_Abbott_notes.pdf).
